            <h3>Prescribed Medication Expectations</h3>

            <p>Effective the first day of school, all medications to be taken at school must be cleared with the Health Center nurse and we must have the <a href="http://www.foxcroftacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Health-Center-Mailing-2015-2016.pdf" target="_blank">Prescription Medication Form</a> filled out by the student’s medical provider. Whenever possible, the scheduling of medication should be altered to allow the student to receive all doses at home. Students may not transport their own medications to school except as defined below. It is the responsibility of the parent/guardian to know and follow these directions.</p>
            <p>Both over-the-counter medications and short-term prescriptions need to be in a sealed envelope or container with the student’s name, medication name, dosage and instructions. Your written request is required for medications to be administered to your child.</p>
            <p>Prescription medications to be administered for longer than two weeks must be sent in the current prescription container with the student’s name, medication name, special instructions and provider’s name. Upon request, your pharmacist will provide you with a second empty prescription container with the required information. Your written request, as well as the provider’s order, must be on file before we can give your child his/her medication. Students may carry their inhalers and/or epinephrine pens with them. You <b>MUST</b> have your medical provider complete the <a href="http://www.foxcroftacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Health-Center-Mailing-2015-2016.pdf" target="_blank">Prescription Medication Form</a> and return it to the school nurse at the time of the request.</p>

            <h3>Immunization Expectations</h3>

            <p><b>All students must comply with the State of Maine requirements for immunizations to attend Foxcroft Academy.</b> If you have submitted your child’s immunization records once, or if they attended SeDoMoCha and are moving into 9th grade, their immunization record should be complete. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Health Center at 564-8351.</p>
            <p><b>State of Maine requirements for Immunizations</b></p>
            <p>All children entering the schools will be required to present their medical immunization records that show compliance with current state law requirements at the time of school admission.  This is shown by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Up-to-date Certificate of Immunization</li>
                <li>A note from your physician stating that child has had chickenpox</li>
                <li>Exemption as described below</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a child is unable to have the required immunizations for medical reasons, a statement to that effect will be required from the family’s doctor.</p>
            <p>If a child’s parent objects to the required immunizations based on religion or personal/philosophical reasons, an annual written statement indicating this will be required from the parent. However, during an outbreak of a disease, a child who has not been immunized will be excluded from school for the duration of the outbreak, as determined by Maine CDC.</p>
            <p>School health records need to include the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The child’s name and date of birth</li>
                <li>A minimum of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>5 DPT (4 DPT if 4th given after 4th birthday)</li>
                        <li>4 Polio (3 Polio if 3rd given after 4th birthday)</li>
                        <li>2 MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) which must be given on or after the first birthday</li>
                        <li>Varicella- one dose if given before age 13; or, children age 13 or over with no reliable history of chickenpox or vaccination should receive 2 doses of Varicella vaccine given at least 4 weeks apart.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                <li>Each immunization entry must include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vaccine type</li>
                        <li>Date administered</li>
                        <li>Name of provider or:

                                <li>Proof of disease by note from provider (chickenpox only)</li>
                                <li>A signed letter of exemption for missing immunizations</li>

            <p><b>Bus Riding Regulations</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Student will sit properly in the seats and remain seated while the bus is in motion.</li>
                <li>Students will be respectful of the bus driver and refrain form the use of loud, boisterous, vulgar or inappropriate language or gestures at all times.</li>
                <li>While entering, exiting or moving on the bus, students will walk in an orderly fashion and not push or shove others.</li>
                <li>Students will not place any part of their body out the windows or display any inappropriate gestures through the windows.</li>
                <li>There will be no use or display of alcohol, drugs, tobacco, or flame-producing device.  The possession of any knife or weapon is strictly prohibited, and will be referred to law enforcement officials.</li>
                <li>There will be no throwing of any object within or out of the bus at any time.</li>
                <li>There will be no fighting while riding on the bus.</li>

                <li>No perfumes, colognes or sprays may be used on the bus.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Violation of regulations 2, 5, 6, and 7 will result in immediate suspension. Violation of any other regulations may as well if the driver determines it necessary and justified.</p>
            <p><b>Consequences</b></p>
            <p>Drivers of school buses are authorized to enforce the safety and riding regulations and to make decisions as necessary in the interest of the safe conveyance of school children. If children fail to comply with regulations or wishes of the bus driver, suspension or expulsion from riding privileges may result.</p>
            <p>Discipline forms will be used by all drivers to keep student, parents, the school and bus contractor informed about noncompliance of regulations. These will be given directly to the students mailed to the parents, or given to school officials and must be signed by a parent or guardian and returned to the bus driver before the student is allowed to continue riding.</p>
            <p>Depending on the severity and nature of the incident will depend upon the consequences. As the riding regulations state, numbers 2, 5, 6, and 7 will result in immediate suspension; however, violation of any others may also if the drive determines it necessary. The first suspension of riding privileges will be three school days in length the second will be five, and if continual misbehavior results in a third suspension, riding privileges will be suspended for the reminder for the school year or until the bus driver, contractor, parents and student meet with the Superintendent to determine whether the student will be allowed to ride the school bus.</p>
            <p>The school bus disciplinary form will explain the incident and consequences and must be returned to the driver before the student is allowed to continue riding. These notices will be kept on file throughout the school year at each school and the contractor’s office.</p>
            <p>It must be noted that any student suspended from riding one bus will not be permitted to ride on any other bus. This includes sports events and field trips.</p>
            <p>Parents are encouraged to contact the bus contractor if they have any concerns. Drivers will make themselves available to explain any incident in question and how they determined the consequences. If any parent is not satisfied with his/her communication with the contractor or driver, they should then contact the Superintendent of Schools. A log of this communication will be kept at the contractor’s office throughout the school year.</p>
