            <p><em>"Students with one unmet standard from a previously-taken course (resulting in a course grade of D) will have a 9 week standard completion opportunity (SCO) in the quarter immediately following to work on improving that standard. Students who want to take advantage of the SCO may be assigned to an ASP if possible. However, even if assignment to an ASP is not possible given schedule constraints, it is the student's sole responsibility to work with the teacher to improve the unmet standard. If the teacher validates that the student demonstrates proficiency in that standard at or before the end of the SCO timeframe, the student's course grade will be retroactively changed to a C and course credit will be awarded. If the student does not take advantage of the SCO, or does not demonstrate proficiency in that standard at or before the end of the SCO timeframe, the student's course grade will remain a D and course credit will only be earned if and when the student repeats the course and earns a passing grade."</em></p>

        <p><b>Because you earned a ~(storecode) grade of ~(courseGrade) in ~(courseName) with ~(teacherFirstName) ~(teacherLastName), you are eligible for SCO.</b></p>
